# Fortress R SDK

## Usage:

You can download the github module by using [**remotes**](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) R package: To install a certain branch or commit or tag, append it to the repo name, after an `@`:

``` r
remotes::install_github("Atbash-Labs/r-sdk@v0.1.0")
```

The module can then be used as follows:

``` r
library(fortress_sdk)
```
